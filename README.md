* **Purpose of the app:** <br/><br/>
 This app was created for a theoretical charitable organization that facilitates donation of excess food from restaurants to food banks and soup kitchens.  

* **Features:**

    Registration and login available for participating restaurant users; separate login available for admins with different permissions.

    Restaurant users have a profile that allows them to list a new donation for pickup, view all past donations, and update their user info.

    Admin users have a profile that allows them to add view donations to plan a pickup route and remove donations from this list after pickup is complete. They can add new site admins, and can add new food banks to the distribution network.

    Separate information pages are also part of the site:
    - The wasteNOT landing page includes information about the program, about restaurant food donation in general, and about the impacts of food waste.
    - The Hearts Feeding H-town homepage (the theoretical organization sponsoring the wasteNOT program) includes further information about how donations are collected and distributed, a "Thank You" section listing all past/current restaurants who've donated, and a link to another page listing food bank locations in our distribution network.
    - The food bank locations page lists all food banks in the WN/HFH network, along with each food bank's address, website, and hours of operation.
